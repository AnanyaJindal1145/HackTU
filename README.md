# ReliefConnect: A Disaster Relief Management website for HackTU 2024

Disasters can be overwhelming, with information scattered and resources wasted. We want to change that.

Our website connects everyone involved in relief efforts: NGOs, government agencies, and even the public.

## Here's how it works:

### 1. Real-time communication:
No more confusion! Everyone shares updates on needs, resources, and efforts instantly. Think of it as a central hub for disaster response.
### 2. Aid delivery: 
We map needs and resources, finding the best ways to get help to people quickly and fairly. No more wasted resources or forgotten communities.
### 3. Public transparency: 
You'll find clear information about ongoing disasters, trusted NGOs to donate to, and even practical guides on what's most helpful. Donate with confidence, knowing your support makes a difference.


This website isn't just about technology, it's about connecting people and resources. By working together, we can ensure faster, fairer disaster response and help communities recover better.
